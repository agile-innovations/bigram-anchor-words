# Bigram Anchor Words Topic Model

Implementation for the [Bigram Anchor Words Topic Model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-52920-2_12)paper. 
Bag of words is very poor text representation, since that, in traditional topic models, we are losing a lot of information. 
The project goal is to combine linguistic with statistical topic models. 
We propose new Anchor Words Topic Model [1] such as bigrams also could be anchor words.

# Experiments 

You could use following code to repeat published results. A simple way to repeat experiments is to try to understand examples =) I'm sorry that documentation is absent.  

```bash
cd bigram-anchor-words
ipython ./examples/{corpus}/{model}.py
```
